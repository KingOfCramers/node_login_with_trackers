Need to fix adding multiple users, related to ObjectId.

Not sure what's going on, here's my current error message:

    "message": "E11000 duplicate key error collection: CourtAPIDev.users index: trackers.case_id_1 dup key: { : null }"

It must have something to do with having a null field in my trackers model, because it autopopulates it when the user is created.
